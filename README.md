## ðŸŒ± Real-Time Plant Disease Detection

This project uses Computer Vision and a Deep Learning model (TensorFlow/Keras) to detect plant diseases in real-time using a webcam. The model can classify multiple plant species and their common diseases with high accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time plant disease detection using OpenCV.

- Deep learning model trained with TensorFlow/Keras.

- Supports multiple crops like Apple, Corn, Tomato, Potato, Grape, and more.

- Uses a deque-based smoothing mechanism to stabilize predictions over time.

- Simple and interactive â€” just run and detect diseases instantly.

ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy project files into your workspace.

2. Make sure you have the trained model file: trained_model.keras.

3. Run the script:
   python main.py

4. The webcam will open, and predictions will be displayed on the screen.

5. Press q to quit the application


ðŸŒ¾ Supported Classes

The model can detect the following diseases and healthy states:

Apple: Apple Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust, Healthy

Blueberry: Healthy

Cherry: Powdery Mildew, Healthy

Corn (Maize): Cercospora Leaf Spot, Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy

Grape: Black Rot, Esca (Black Measles), Leaf Blight, Healthy

Orange: Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening)

Peach: Bacterial Spot, Healthy

Pepper (Bell): Bacterial Spot, Healthy

Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy

Raspberry: Healthy

Soybean: Healthy

Squash: Powdery Mildew

Strawberry: Leaf Scorch, Healthy

Tomato: Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, Spider Mites, Target Spot, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, Mosaic Virus, Healthy


ðŸ“Š Model Training (Optional)

If you want to train or test the model yourself:

Open Test_Plant_Disease.ipynb.

Use a dataset like PlantVillage.

Train and save your model as trained_model.keras.


âš¡ Future Improvements

- Add a web interface for mobile/remote usage.

- Integrate with IoT devices (Raspberry Pi, drones) for field monitoring.

- Extend dataset for more plant species and diseases.
